# kickstarter-analysis
performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
the overview of this project was to filter data in order to find the results of specific criteria based on the Kickstarter data set.
### Purpose
the purpose to be learn and work through different functions of excel as well as create pivot tables and charts to show "outcomes based on theater launch date" and "outcmes based on release date"

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges i faced during this analysis was making sure I was filtering the pivot tables correctly as well as using the countifs function. I tried watching the video provided, however the ordering of the range and range criterias were confusing me, so I looked up a video on youtube and got it from there! I also rememered how important it is to make values absolute, I had to go back and add the $$ individually after the first column values were reached.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) The failed outcomes had a good trend line, and was in the ranges of 20-50.
2) the successful outcomes had a peaking point in May, and meat with failed outcomes in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The outcomes based on goals was very spiky and the percentage failed was higher than percentage successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
some of the limitations was that the data was not very presentable at first and the date created and date ended were not readable. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
we could create many charts to show every genre in the US, or any other specific country and even create it for a specific genre.
