# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
the overview of this project was to filter data in order to find the results of specific criteria based on the Kickstarter data set.
-Import data into a table for analysis.
-Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.
-Generate and interpret pivot tables.
-Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.
-Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.
-Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.
-Interpret common Excel visualizations.
### Purpose
the purpose to be learn and work through different functions of excel as well as create pivot tables and charts to show "outcomes based on theater launch date" and "outcmes based on release date". 

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges i faced during this analysis was making sure I was filtering the pivot tables correctly as well as using the countifs function. I tried watching the video provided, however the ordering of the range and range criterias were confusing me, so I looked up a video on youtube and got it from there! I also rememered how important it is to make values absolute, I had to go back and add the $$ individually after the first column values were reached.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Because the client was interested in the theater data, and due to the size of the data set, the data was filtered by the theater category. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Her interest was "plays" in the subcategory so an extra filter was applied. the total number of successful, failed, and cancelled outcomes were found for each and converted into percentages.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) there were very few cancelled theater projects.
2) the successful outcomes had a peaking point in May and lasted through June until a steady decline till the end of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1)we can see from the graph that the most successful percentage of outcomes were projects with goals less than 5000 dollars.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-One limitation would be that there were no cancelled plays in subcategories.
 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
we could create many charts to show every genre in the US, or any other specific country and even create it for a specific genre.
